## General Description

The threadpool is a single header and self-contained library. The implementation doesn't have any dependencies other than the C++ standard library. The source code is completely free and open source under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

Actually thread pool has a very simple interface. The `threadpool.hpp` contains all nessasary functionality.
The [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) build system is used for build in C++ 11/14/17 projects.
The [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) framework is used for unit testing the library API.
